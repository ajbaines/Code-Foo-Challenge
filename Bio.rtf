\f0\fs24 \cf0 My name is Antoine Baines and I am a 3rd computer science engineering student at the University of Michigan.  I have been gaming since the age of five when my father purchased a sega genesis for me and a SNES for my brother.  Ever since then I have been playing video games and owned at least one of the major gaming consoles in each generation.  My favorite genre of games are Action/Adventure, RPG, and platformers.  As I got older I realized I enjoyed using and computer and wanted to learn how it worked so I began to look into computer science and computer engineering.  While studying computer science I was exposed to video game development and enjoyed developing video games.  I also was given the chance to work with web design at my first internship with Microsoft.  While there I designed a template that would make all of the information that a user would want on full site be present on a mobile site and still being fully functional as if it was the full site.}
